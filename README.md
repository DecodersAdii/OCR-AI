This OCR project involves extracting text from images and integrating a feature to send the extracted text to the OpenAI API for question-answering functionality. This combines text recognition with AI-driven content analysis to provide insightful responses based on the extracted data.

Image Input

Users upload an image or provide a file as input.
Text Extraction Using OCR

Implement Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using libraries like Tesseract, OpenCV, or similar tools.
Process the image to recognize and extract textual content.
Preprocessing the Extracted Text

Clean and format the extracted text (remove noise, unwanted symbols, or irrelevant content).
Integration with OpenAI API

Send the preprocessed text to the OpenAI API for analysis or question-answering.
Use the APIâ€™s capabilities to generate relevant responses or insights based on the input text.
Response Display

Display the results or answers generated by the API in a user-friendly format on the interface.
Frontend Implementation

Create an intuitive user interface to upload images, view extracted text, and see the API-generated answers.
Backend Implementation

Set up a backend system to handle image processing, API calls, and data flow between frontend and backend.
Testing and Optimization

Test the accuracy of text extraction and API responses.
Optimize the OCR process for better recognition and integrate error-handling mechanisms for API requests.
Deployment

Host the project on a platform like Heroku, AWS, or any other server to make it accessible to users.
Enhancements (Optional)

Add support for multiple languages.
Include features like text summarization, translation, or data export.
